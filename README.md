## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge that takes place during the month of December. Each day, participants are presented with two coding puzzles that cover a variety of algorithms and data structures. It's a fun and engaging way to improve your problem-solving skills and explore new programming concepts.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized by days, with each day having its own folder containing the solutions. The folder naming convention follows the format `dayXX`, where `XX` is the day number. Within each day's folder, you will find the C# source code files and any additional resources necessary for solving the puzzles.

Example:

```
/AdventOfCode2023
  /day1
    - day1_p1.cs
    - day2_p2.cs
  /day2
    - day2_p1.cs
    - day2_p2.cs
  ...
```
